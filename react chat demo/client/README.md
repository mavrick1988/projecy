This app was created in react.js ,node.js, css and coded in vs code.
this package need to be installed,  socket.io-client.
first you need to have CORS extension added and enabled on your browser so that the server can locate the frontend's url. 
second, open your cmd prompt and locate the folder "/react chat demo/client"
type "npm install socket.io-client" then type "npm start" and your browser should open automatically.
third, open another cmd prompt window and locate "react chat demo/server"
type and enter "npm i express socket-io nodemon" then type and enter "npm start" and you should see now the server being initialized.
fourth, when you see the app on your browse, login credentials are as follows: 
Name: (Your name)
Email:admin@admin.com
password:admin123

and that's it, i put my name as the default on the chat system since this just a sample program.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
